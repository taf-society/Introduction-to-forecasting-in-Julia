    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Time Series Forecasting with Durbyn.jl**, a comprehensive training course designed to take you from Julia fundamentals to advanced forecasting workflows using the Durbyn.jl package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Durbyn.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "**Durbyn** — Kurdish for \"binoculars\" (*Dur*, far + *Byn*, to see) — is a native Julia package for time-series forecasting, inspired by the R **forecast** and **fable** packages. It provides a modern, formula-based grammar for declarative model specification with full support for panel data, model comparison, and tidy forecasting workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Durbyn.jl is developed by the [Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Society (TAFS)](https://taf-society.org/), a non-profit association registered in Vienna, Austria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This training is organised into five chapters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Julia Fundamentals** — Data types, functions, control flow, multiple dispatch, and the Julia type system. Essential knowledge for working productively in the Julia ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Wrangling with TableOps** — Durbyn's built-in data manipulation toolkit. Load, reshape, filter, group, and transform time series data using a dplyr-inspired API built on Tables.jl.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Analysis and Time Series Fundamentals** — ACF/PACF analysis, Box-Cox transformations, classical and STL decomposition, stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS, Phillips-Perron), differencing, and Fourier terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Forecasting with Durbyn.jl** — The full suite of forecasting models: ETS (exponential smoothing state space), ARIMA, BATS, TBATS, Theta, ARAR/ARARMA, Croston (intermittent demand), and Naive methods. Both the array interface and the formula-based grammar are covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Panel Data Forecasting: An M3 Competition Case Study** — A complete end-to-end workflow using the M3 competition dataset: data preparation, exploratory analysis, multi-model specification, parallel fitting, forecast generation, accuracy evaluation, and model comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graduate-level statistics (hypothesis testing, regression, maximum likelihood)\n",
    "- Basic programming experience (any language)\n",
    "- No prior Julia experience required — Chapter 1 covers all essentials\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Julia 1.11+ from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/).\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this training, we use the **M3 Competition** dataset Makridakis & Hibon (2000), which contains 3,003 real-world time series at yearly, quarterly, and monthly frequencies across domains including micro, macro, industry, finance, demographic, and other categories. Each series is split into a training portion (`x`) and a hold-out test portion (`xx`), making it ideal for evaluating forecast accuracy.\n",
